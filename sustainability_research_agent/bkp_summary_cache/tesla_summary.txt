Based on the provided text snippets, Tesa has embedded sustainability as a central, science-based component of its corporate strategy, supported by significant investment and driven by innovation across its global value chain. Guided by frameworks like the UN Global Compact and SDGs, the company focuses on environmental, social, and governance responsibility, pursuing an SBTi-validated Net-Zero target by 2045/2050.

Key environmental goals include achieving climate-neutral production (Scope 1 & 2) by 2030 and reducing absolute Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2030 (vs. 2018). Significant progress is noted, with a 39% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions and ~90-100% of global electricity from renewable sources. Initiatives cover energy efficiency, solvent-free processes, renewable energy investment, and decoupling growth from emissions. A major focus is on sustainable materials and circularity, targeting 70% recycled or bio-based content for products and packaging by 2030 and a 50% reduction in non-recycled fossil plastic packaging by 2025. The company also targets zero production waste to landfill by 2025, addresses responsible water management, and focuses on circular product design and packaging optimization.

Social aspects emphasize employee well-being and development, including fostering a positive culture, continuous training (including mandatory sustainability training), health management, diversity and inclusion (with gender equality targets), and occupational health & safety (zero-accident target, robust management systems). Commitments extend to ensuring human rights and fair working conditions in the supply chain through a Code of Conduct and grievance mechanisms, and ensuring product safety and quality.

Governance highlights include the integration of sustainability into the corporate strategy with clear management board responsibility. Robust compliance (Code of Conduct, CMS, training, whistleblower system, anti-corruption) and adherence to international standards underpin operations. Supply chain governance focuses on responsible sourcing, transparency, and supplier engagement, with a target for 80% of direct purchasing volume from suppliers meeting sustainability standards by 2030. External ratings (EcoVadis Gold, CDP 'A' for Climate) and certifications demonstrate accountability and drive improvement.

Overall, Tesa demonstrates a comprehensive approach to ESG, integrating these principles throughout the value chain and product lifecycle, recognized by achievements like the EcoVadis Gold medal.
